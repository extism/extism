# a Context provides a scope for plugins to be managed within. creating multiple contexts
# is expected and groups plugins based on source/tenant/lifetime etc.
# We recommend you use `Extism.with_context` unless you have a reason to keep your context around.
# If you do you can create a context with `Extism#new`, example: `ctx = Extism.new`
