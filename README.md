# Overview

Extism is a lightweight framework for building with WebAssembly (Wasm). It
supports running Wasm code on servers, the edge, CLIs, IoT, browsers and
everything in between. Extism is designed to be "universal" in that it supports
a common interface, no matter where it runs.

> **Note:** One of the primary use cases for Extism is **building extensible
> software & plugins**. You want to be able to execute arbitrary, untrusted code
> from your users? Extism makes this safe and practical to do.

Additionally, Extism adds some extra utilities on top of standard Wasm runtimes.
For example, we support persistent memory/module-scope variables, secure &
host-controlled HTTP without WASI, runtime limiters & timers, simpler host
function linking, and more. Extism users build:

- plug-in systems
- FaaS platforms
- code generators
- web applications
- & much more...

# Supported Targets

We currently provide releases for the following targets:

- aarch64-apple-darwin
- aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
- aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
- x86_64-apple-darwin
- x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
- x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
- x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
- x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

For Android we suggest taking a look at the [Chicory SDK](https://github.com/extism/chicory-sdk) for a pure Java
Extism runtime.

# Compile WebAssembly to run in Extism Hosts

Extism Hosts (running the SDK) must execute WebAssembly code that has a
[PDK, or Plug-in Development Kit](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/pdk), library
compiled in to the `.wasm` binary. PDKs make it easy for plug-in / extension
code authors to read input from the host and return data back, read provided
configuration, set/get variables, make outbound HTTP calls if allowed, and more.

Pick a PDK to import into your Wasm program, and refer to the documentation to
get started:

# Generating Bindings

It's often very useful to define a schema to describe the function signatures
and types you want to use between Extism SDK and PDK languages.

[XTP Bindgen](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-bindgen) is an open source
framework to generate PDK bindings for Extism plug-ins. It's used by the
[XTP Platform](https://www.getxtp.com/), but can be used outside of the platform
to define any Extism compatible plug-in system.

## 1. Install the `xtp` CLI.

See installation instructions
[here](https://docs.xtp.dylibso.com/docs/cli#installation).

## 2. Create a schema using our OpenAPI-inspired IDL:

```yaml
version: v1-draft
exports: 
  CountVowels:
      input: 
          type: string
          contentType: text/plain; charset=utf-8
      output:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/VowelReport"
          contentType: application/json
# components.schemas defined in example-schema.yaml...
```

> See an example in [example-schema.yaml](./example-schema.yaml), or a full
> "kitchen sink" example on
> [the docs page](https://docs.xtp.dylibso.com/docs/concepts/xtp-schema/).

## 3. Generate bindings to use from your plugins:

```
xtp plugin init --schema-file ./example-schema.yaml
  > 1. TypeScript                      
    2. Go                              
    3. Rust                            
    4. Python                          
    5. C#                              
    6. Zig                             
    7. C++                             
    8. GitHub Template                 
    9. Local Template
```

This will create an entire boilerplate plugin project for you to get started
with. Implement the empty function(s), and run `xtp plugin build` to compile
your plugin.

> [dylibso/xtp-bindgen](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-bindgen) repository and
